# BMI Project

This Vue.js project, created using Vue 3, marks my first attempt at Vue.js development. As a beginner, I decided to build a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator to apply my newfound skills and explore Vue 3's capabilities.

## Features

- **BMI Calculator:** The core functionality of the project is a user-friendly BMI calculator. Users can input their height and weight, and the application computes and displays their BMI.

- **Vue 3 Implementation:** Leveraging the power of Vue 3, the project embraces the reactivity system and component-based architecture for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
